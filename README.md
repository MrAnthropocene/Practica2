# Practica 2
## **Practica 2 web design applications**

### **The main goal of this practice was to create a responsive product page using Flexbox.

A layout was created with two columns: the left side for the product and its description, and the right side for the price and the "Add to cart" button.

Using Flexbox, the columns were positioned ensuring that the design adjusts to smaller screens.

Finally, a design style was applied to the page.
